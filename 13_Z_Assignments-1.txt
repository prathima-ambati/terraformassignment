Create Ghost module
Create a directory called ghost.
Your modules will be made up of three files: main.tf, variables.tf and outputs.tf.

main.tf
In main.tf you will deploy out two resources docker_image and docker_container. The docker_image resource name will be ghost_image.
The name will use th image_name variable.
The docker_container resource name will be ghost_container.
The name will be set using a varialbe called container_name. The image will be set usingdocker_image.ghost_image.latest. Set the external port to use the ext_port variable.

variables.tf
In variables.tf create three varialbes: image_name, container_name and ext_port.

outputs.tf
In outputs.tf create two outputs: ip and container_name. The ip output the ghost_container's ip_address attribute.
The container_name output the ghost_container's name attribute.

Create root module
main.tf
In cloud_user directory create main.tf, variables.tf and outputs.tf. In main.tf will use the ghost module.
Set image_name using a variable called image_name.
Set container_name using a variable called container_name.
Set ext_port using a variable called ext_port.
In variables.tf create three image_name, container_name and ext_port.

variables.tf
The image_name will have a default value of ghost:latest with a description of Image for container.
The container_name will have a default value of blogwith a description ofName of the container.  
Theext_portwill have adefaultvalue of 80 with a description of External port for container.

outputs.tf
In outputs.tf create two outputs: ip and container_name. The ip output the ghost_container's ip_address attribute.
The container_name output the ghost_container's name attribute.

Deploy the infrastructure
Initialize Terraform.
Generate a Terraform plan and output a plan file.
Deploy the infrastructure using the plan file.

1. Create a ghost module

 -->mkdir ghost
 -->ls
ghost

--> touch main.tf variables.tf outputs.tf
-->ls
main.tf  outputs.tf  variables.tf

-->cat outputs.tf
output "container_name" {
  value = "${docker_container.ghost_container.name}"
}
output "container_ip" {
  value = "${docker_container.ghost_container.ip_address}"
}

--> cat variables.tf
variable "image_name" {
  description = "Name of the image"
  default = "ghost:latest"
}
variable "container_name" {
  description = "Name of the container"
  default = "ghost_blog"
}
variable "ext_port" {
  default = "80"
}


-->  cat main.tf
resource "docker_image" "ghost_image" {
  name = "${var.image_name}"
}
resource "docker_container" "ghost_container" {
  name = "${var.container_name}"
  image = "${docker_image.ghost_image.latest}"
  ports {
    external = "${var.ext_port}"
    internal = "2368"

  }

--> terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "docker" (terraform-providers/docker) 2.6.0...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.docker: version = "~> 2.6"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:
